# Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG)

## Description

This repository provides a Rust-based implementation of a quantum random number generator (QRNG) that utilizes the inherent randomness of the CPU clock to generate truly unpredictable sequences of bits. The QRNG algorithm is based on the principle of quantum uncertainty, which states that certain pairs of physical properties cannot be simultaneously determined with arbitrary precision. In the context of the CPU clock, this implies that the exact position and momentum of the electrons involved in the clock's operation cannot be precisely known simultaneously. This intrinsic uncertainty translates into randomness in the timing of the clock ticks.

The QRNG algorithm in this repository involves measuring the current timestamp in nanoseconds (ns) using the `Instant::now()` function. This measurement introduces further randomness due to the inherent uncertainty of the quantum system. The precise timestamp value is determined by the state of the electrons in the CPU's clock circuitry, which is subject to quantum fluctuations.

The provided QRNG generates truly random bits that can be used to fortify cryptographic systems and enhance the reliability of simulation results. It is suitable for various applications, including securing sensitive communication channels, generating tamper-proof digital signatures, and enhancing the accuracy of Monte Carlo simulations and artificial intelligence algorithms.
